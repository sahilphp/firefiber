## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Composer archives no longer include the development `composer.lock`,
  PHPUnit configuration, or local `*.bak`/backup middleware files.
- The package is explicitly a library and refuses
  `composer create-project sahilphp/firefiber` through
  `post-create-project-cmd`, exiting 1 with installation guidance.
